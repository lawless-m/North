Threaded Interpretive Language for Node.js

Inspired by Loeliger's Threaded Interpretive Languages this project has evolved from a bunch of AVR assembler Macros to client side Javascript and now to the heady heights of server side Javascript. I feel that this is the final destination, I will be using it with Browserify as I go along and including dictionaries for Canvas and Audio for which I have long planned projects.

It's main distinguishing feature is that a Cell can contain any Javascript value rather than just a byte, including functions, arrays and objects.


I hope someone gets some use out of it.

I wish my dear friend Uriel was still with us to share it. The Internet brought us together and the Internet took you away.
